## The Problem

Nowadays, people are finding it hard to communicate to their families more than ever. With so many things and appointments in our lives, we sometimes forget about movie night with the family or Easter brunch with grandma and grandpa.
Parents and grandparents want to communicate with their children more, in a way that the youth are doing it. We can know this by seeing older generations are having smartphone in their hands. But to use it, parents and grandparents often trouble their kids to teach them how to do it so many times. And it is such a hassle!
For younger parents, their problem is a little bit different. Most of young parents give smartphone to their kids since they are still in the elementary grade to ease the communication between them as well as to track them to make sure that theyâ€™re safe.

## The Idea & Features

An integrated mobile app that has all of the solutions for the problems above would be the ideal mobile app. However, the mobile app should be very user friendly, especially towards elders and kids.

The mobile app will include:
- Chats and calls
- Photos, audios, and videos sharing
- Memo, to-do list, reminders, and calendar sharing
- GPS tracking system
- Gaming

And to make it user friendly, it has to be:
- Simple and clean design
- Should be light, fast responsive
- Easy-to-read fonts.
